<h4 id="senior-software-engineer---performance-optimization--algorithms">Senior Software Engineer - Performance Optimization &amp; Algorithms</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved the performance of our robotic warehouse automation system.</li>
<li>Used profiling and other tools to find hot-spots in the application with an aim to improve the performance of the system</li>
<li>Improve the tooling around development, profiling, testing and any other space that could use a productivity boost</li>
<li>Evaluated the differences between how customers use the platform and find opportunities to improve performance by optimizing the algorithms or issues in the system.</li>
<li>Overhauled a UI application that provided deeper visibility into the internals of the core allocation application - this was very useful for answering oncall questions from internal and external customers.</li>
<li>Evaluated the possibility of moving the system over to the Rust programming language using a minimal implementation of the core allocation algorithm. The limited prototype performed around 10x and the memory usage reduced by around 3X.</li>

<h4 id="simulia-developer-manager">SIMULIA Developer Manager</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved the performance and scalability of the DigitalRock discretizer by utilizing input information to enhance initial decomposition, this provided up to a 10% improvement compared to prior releases. The discretizer is a piece of software that takes input geometry and case definitions and performs, booleans, geometry validation and cleanup and prepares the model for simulation.</li>
<li>Added support to balance the load amongst the various discretization processes in a parallel run. This is required since the initial decomposition does not accurately capture the distribution of computational load in typical production case, more over the load cannot be determined a-priori, a dynamic load balancing scheme based on work stealing was developed to overcome this problem.</li>
<li>Added the ability to re-decompose the domain in parallel to reduce fragmentation of the grid across various processes. This operation is intended to minimize the boundary of the domain owned by a process, which in turn reduces the volume of network calls and improves overall scalability.</li>

<h4 id="senior-software-engineer">Senior Software Engineer</h4>
<ul>
<li>Augmented the file IO features in the PowerFLOW Discretizer to support distributing input file data to multiple processors and writing output files from data received from multiple processors.</li>
<li>Created wrappers and additional utility methods around the MPI library to simplify the development of the parallel discretizer while providing greater visibility into the system to assist with debugging and profiling.</li>
<li>Added shared memory support for the discretizer using the POSIX spec to amortize the cost of storing input information across all processors. This reduced the memory load on a node and improved scalability of the PowerFLOW Discretizer.</li>
<li>Added support to read images, convert them to 3D geometry using the marching cubes algorithm and use the geometry in downstream disctretizations and simulations. This is used as a part of Exa DigitalROCK offering, these efforts along with the parallelization reduced turnaround time for large simulations from days and weeks to hours.</li>

<ul>
<li>Extended the Normal Ray Refinement (NRR) methodology to 3D Bodies in NASCART-GT (a cartesian gird based naiver-stokes solver for hypersonic flows), reducing computational cost of viscous simulations by 30-60% with minimal loss in accuracy</li>
<li>Streamlined the programming procedures in the lab by introducing IDE’s integrated with source versioning systems, documentation systems, profiling and performance analysis tools, reducing the time for feature additions, bug fixes and increasing collaboration.</li>
