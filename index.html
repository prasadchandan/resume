Software Engineer - Performance Optimization &amp; Algorithms</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved the performance of the robotic warehouse automation system
employed at 6 River Systems</li>
<li>Used profiling and other tools to find hot-spots in the application
with an aim to improve the performance of the system</li>
<li>Improved the tooling around development, profiling and testing that
improved developer productivity</li>
<li>Overhauled an UI application that provided a deeper visibility into
the internals of the core scheduling robot picking algorithms - this was
very useful for answering support questions from internal and external
customers.</li>
<li>Evaluated the possibility of moving the scheduling service over to
the Rust programming language as a part of a hack-days project. Used a
minimal prototype of the core optimization algorithm to validate the
gains, the limited prototype improved performance by about 10x and the
memory usage reduced by around 3X.<br />
</li>
<li>Evaluated replacing the core data-structure used for storing the
in-memory objects with a C++ library wrapped with N-API to improve
performance.</li>

<h4 id="simulia-developer-manager">SIMULIA Developer Manager</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved the performance and scalability of the DigitalRock
discretizer by utilizing input information to enhance initial
decomposition, this provided up to a 10% improvement compared to prior
releases. The discretizer is a piece of software that takes input
geometry and case definitions and performs, booleans, geometry
validation and cleanup and prepares the model for simulation.</li>
<li>Added support to balance the load amongst the various discretization
processes in a parallel run. This is required since the initial
decomposition does not accurately capture the distribution of
computational load in typical production case, more over the load cannot
be determined a-priori, a dynamic load balancing scheme based on work
stealing was developed to overcome this problem.</li>
<li>Added the ability to re-decompose the domain in parallel to reduce
fragmentation of the grid across various processes. This operation is
intended to minimize the boundary of the domain owned by a process,
which in turn reduces the volume of network calls and improves overall
scalability.</li>

<h4 id="senior-software-engineer">Senior Software Engineer</h4>
<ul>
<li>Augmented the file IO features in the PowerFLOW Discretizer to
support distributing input file data to multiple processors and writing
output files from data received from multiple processors.</li>
<li>Created wrappers and additional utility methods around the MPI
library to simplify the development of the parallel discretizer while
providing greater visibility into the system to assist with debugging
and profiling.</li>
<li>Added shared memory support for the discretizer using the POSIX spec
to amortize the cost of storing input information across all processors.
This reduced the memory load on a node and improved scalability of the
PowerFLOW Discretizer.</li>
<li>Added support to read images, convert them to 3D geometry using the
marching cubes algorithm and use the geometry in downstream
disctretizations and simulations. This is used as a part of Exa
DigitalROCK offering, these efforts along with the parallelization
reduced turnaround time for large simulations from days and weeks to
hours.</li>

<ul>
<li>Improved the handling of 'toroidal' geometry (eg. Treating opposing
faces of a cube as abutting) in the discretizer.</li>
<li>Improved integration testing by creating a new test suite and
streamlined the process to create new test cases.</li>
<li>Added initial support for parallel discretizations in the next
generation discretizer.</li>

<ul>
<li>Extended the Normal Ray Refinement (NRR) methodology to 3D Bodies in
NASCART-GT (a cartesian gird based naiver-stokes solver for hypersonic
flows), reducing computational cost of viscous simulations by 30-60%
with minimal loss in accuracy</li>
<li>Streamlined the programming procedures in the lab by introducing
IDE’s integrated with source versioning systems, documentation systems,
profiling and performance analysis tools, reducing the time for feature
additions, bug fixes and increasing collaboration.</li>
<li>Developing a solver based on the cartesian grid methodology using
C++ (ported features from the Fortran based codebase) - this effort lead
